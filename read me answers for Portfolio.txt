Node File Generator

The Node File Generator writes a README.md file and is populated by user input via prompts. The file contains a Title, table of Contents, information about the license, contributors, installation, usage, and testing. A gif demonstrates the operation of the generator.

AS A developer I WANT a README generator SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
